# Data Story — Optimize Digital Marketing Channels

**Author / Verification:** 23f3001359@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

**Snapshot average CAC (as computed): 229.56**

---

## Summary (Executive)
The company's **average Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is 229.56**, which is materially above the industry benchmark of **150**. This gap (~53% higher) indicates inefficient marketing spend allocation and/or conversion process issues. The recommended solution: **optimize digital marketing channels** to reduce CAC toward the industry benchmark.

---

## Key Findings (from the analysis)
- Average CAC (dataset): **229.56**.
- Trend: CAC has an upward component in the most recent quarters; peaks are visible in specific quarters.
- Benchmark comparison: company avg (229.56) vs industry benchmark (150) — significant gap.
- Root-cause hypotheses:
  - Heavy reliance on paid channels with rising CPC.
  - Declining conversion rates on landing pages.
  - Underinvestment in organic channels (SEO & referrals) that historically show lower CAC.

---

## Business Implications
- At current CAC levels, marketing ROI is reduced; customer lifetime value (LTV)/CAC ratio deteriorates.
- If unchecked, higher CAC forces either increased marketing budget or slower growth.
- Strategic resource allocation is required to avoid wasting marketing spend and to improve long-term margins.

## Specific Recommendations to reach the target of 150
1. **Rebalance marketing mix (immediate, reallocation target 15–20%)**
   - Move budget from lower-performing paid channels to organic/partnership/referral channels.
2. **Conversion funnel optimization (3–6 months)**
   - Simplify landing pages, reduce steps in signup, remove friction, run systematic A/B tests.
3. **Invest in organic acquisition (6–12 months)**
   - Content/SEO, referral incentives, partnerships with relevant platforms.
4. **Measure, iterate, and guardrails**
   - Track CAC by channel weekly; set automated alerts if channel CAC rises >10% MoM.
5. **Pilot program**
   - Launch a 3-month pilot with reallocated budget and measure delta CAC, CPA, and conversion uplift.

Projected impact from recommended moves (conservative estimate): reduce CAC from **229.56 → ~160** within 12 months; further optimizations could approach industry target of **150**.
